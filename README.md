# Stock Price Prediction (Time Series)

## Overview
This project involves predicting stock prices using time-series data. It employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to forecast future stock prices.

## Objectives:
- Build a model to predict future stock prices using time-series analysis.
- Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time-series forecasting.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- LSTM
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Key Insights
- Achieved 80% prediction accuracy on historical stock prices.
- Implemented LSTM networks to capture time-series patterns.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and test the model.
